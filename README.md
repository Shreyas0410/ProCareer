# ProCareer
## About
ProCareer is an innovative project built during a hackathon in just 2 days, designed to help users navigate their career paths with AI-powered insights and personalized recommendations.

Built using the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)**, the platform integrates the **Gemini API** on the backend along with **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.  
This setup allows the system to extract relevant information from a user’s resume, generate context-aware questions, and evaluate responses to provide intelligent career guidance.
